8. [A problem posed by Jon Bentley] The diameter of a set of points on the plane is the
distance between its two most widely separated points. For example, the diameter of the
set
{(1, 1), (0, 0), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 0)}
is 5, the distance between the points (0,0) and (3,4). Given a set of points, you are to
compute its diameter to within an accuracy of ±5%. There is a 5-second execution-time
limit on this problem.
The input to your program will consist of up to 100,000 pairs of integers giving x-y
coordinates of points in free format (that is, separated by whitespace only, with no commas
or parentheses). The output should be a single ﬂoating-point (or integer) number giving
an approximate diameter.
Example:

Input 
1 1 0 0 2 3
3 4 1
0

Output
5.0
