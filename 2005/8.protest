The first case in the example (from (0,0) to (0,1)) takes two steps, not
one; likewise, the answer to the next case should be 1 and not 2.

< Case 0: (0, 0) to (0, 1) takes 2 steps
< Case 1: (0, 0) to (1, 0) takes 1 step
< Case 2: (1, 2) to (1, 1) takes 4 steps
---
> Case 1: (0, 0) to (0, 1) takes 1 step
> Case 2: (0, 0) to (1, 0) takes 2 steps
> Case 3: (1, 2) to (1, 1) takes 4 steps
