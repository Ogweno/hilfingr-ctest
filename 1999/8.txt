8. You are given a base-36 numeral (the digits are 0–9, a–z, with a worth 10, b 11, etc.)
and told that it comes from the set of all numbers having the same digits (that is, the same
number of each digit the given number has). We allow leading 0’s. You are to print out
the next number from that set (in ascending order). For example, given 03snd3fk5ee2,
you should print 03snd3fke25e.

The input will consist of any number of base-36 numerals up to 128 digits long in free
format. For each, compute the next number in its set (you may assume there is one) in
the format shown below:

Example.
Input 			Output
12 03snd3fk5ee2 	12 -> 21
			03snd3fk5ee2 -> 03snd3fke25e
